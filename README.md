# PIG-ST2018-6thPointAssignment
Additional assignment for the university  course "Python in GIS" at the University of MÃ¼nster in the summer term 2018

# Analysis of elevation differences measured by GPS and Lidar and the impact of the land cover type

In this assignment the difference in the elevation between DEM values and measured values with GPS are analyzed with a python script.

To run this script you have to open it in QGis. Additionally, you have to put into the LandCoverVsElevation script:
* the absolute path where the scripts are (where you downloaded the folder)
* the path to an arbitrary gpx file (available for example here: <https://m.gpsies.com/trackList.do>)
* the path to an DEM
* the path to the land cover model from Copernicus (available here: <https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover>

After these requirements are fulfilled just run the LandCoverVsElevation.py script.
